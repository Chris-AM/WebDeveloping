                        Hunter × Hunter is an anime television series that aired from 2011 to 2014 based on Yoshihiro Togashi's Hunter × Hunter manga. The story begins with a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father who he thought was dead, is in fact
                        alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging, is a legendary "Hunter", an individual who has proven themselves an elite member of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives in order to pursue his own
                        dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow in his father's footsteps, pass the rigorous "Hunter Examination", and eventually find his father to become a Hunter in his own right.
